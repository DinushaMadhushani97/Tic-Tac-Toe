🤔 Tic Tac Toe Game

👋 I'm thrilled to share my latest project with you – a Tic Tac Toe Game! 🎮

Would you like to play a round of Tic Tac Toe? It's a classic and fun game that brings back memories! This was my recent project where I designed the frontend using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 🚀

How to Play:

Visit the Home Page: Before diving into the game, check out the home page for detailed instructions on how to play. 🏡

Choose Your Symbol: You can be "O" or the challenger "X." The choice is yours! ⭕❌

Challenging AI: The computer always takes the opposite role. It's usually easy to win, but sometimes it throws in a challenge! 🤖💡

This game brings back some childhood memories and offers a bit of a challenge. Can you beat the computer? 🚀💪
